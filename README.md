# TasksApp
- This is my first project towards learning angular .to practice simple crud operations and angular basics.
- This app is based on the tutorial in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8&ab_channel=TraversyMedia and since the layout and styling was not the aim of this app so i copied most of the styling from the original code ,Also some parts are based on this tutorial https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular8/angular8_authentication_and_authorization.htm . and i have added some functionality on my own.
- it has a simple login scheme not a real auth based login , just type admin in the user name and password to log in .
- It's a simple task tracking app that uses a simple js server as its backend api.
- I aimed to learn the basics of angular such as the structure of the angular project and the basics of compontets and services , data binding , input forms, localstorage ,  routes, guards and navigation. the communication between components in 3 different ways , viewChild, Input and Output decorators and the subjects way.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
